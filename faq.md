## I'm having a network connection issue, what should I do?

Exploratory Desktop requires an internet connection for authenticating the users, downloading the required software like Git and R if you don't have them installed yet, accessing to remote data sources like Google Analytics, Web Scraping, and publishing Note. Note that you can still work with offline mode with offline data as long as the initial setup is done.

If you use a proxy server to connect to the internet, as default it automatically tries to detect the proxy server and connect through the server. This should work for most of the times, but with certain scenarios it might not. In such cases you can manually add your proxy server information to a configuration file 'userconf.json', which can be found at ‘~/.exploratory’ for Mac OS X or ‘<your_user_home_folder>/.exploratory’ for Windows as follows. Here's an example.

**Set a proxy server:**

```
{
   "user": "dummy1",
   "proxy": {
     "server": "<your_proxy_server>",
     "port": <port_number>,
     "user": "<username>",
     "password": "<password>"
   }
}
```

Once the proxy server information is set, save the file and restart Exploratory Desktop. If you still encounter the network issue please contact at support@exploratory.io .

## Why are you asking my password for OS X at the initial installation time?

If you don't have R and/or Git previously installed you will be asked to enter your Mac OS admin username and password. This is because R and Git installation require the system administrator's privilege. We don't see or capture this information, it's completely done by R and Git installers and that's outside of Exploratory. ;)

## I have already installed R (rstats) 3.2 installed and don't want to upgrade to 3.3 right now.

Good news! We have prepared one variation of Exploratory Desktop for Mac for R 3.2. Please click 'Are you R 3.2 users?' link right below the download button on the download page. This will make the download button to download Exploratory Desktop for R 3.2. This version will check your R version, and as long as it is 3.2.0 or greater then it won't install any R.

## I have already installed R (rstats) 3.3, are you going to install another R ?

No. we check the R version that is installed on your pc, but as long as it is 3.3.0 or grater then Exploratory will use that one, without installing any R.

## I don't have R installed, what are you going to do ?

Please download Exploratory Desktop by simply clicking on Download button on the download page. It will install R 3.3 as part of the initial setup. You will be asked to enter your Mac OS admin username and password, this is because R installation would require the system administrator's privilege. We don't capture this information, it's completely done by R installer itself.

## I have installed R with Homebrew on Mac OS X, does that work ?

Unfortunately the configuration of R installed with Homebrew is not supported currently. Exploratory Desktop requires a set of R packages to make your data wrangling and analysis more efficient from the day one. To install those packages we use the binary versions of the packages, which assume that R is installed with the standard installer with '.pkg' from CRAN. If you would like to use Exploratory Desktop, the workaround is to uninstall R with Homebrew with the command below, then restart Exploratory Desktop, which will install R 3.3 with the standard installer from CRAN.

```
> brew uninstall r
```

## What version of R is required ?

- R 3.2.0 or greater for Exploratory Desktop for R (rstats) 3.2 version.
- R 3.3.0 or greater for Exploratory Desktop for R (rstats) 3.3 version.

## What version of Git is required ?

Git version requirement is loosened recently and the latest Exploratory Desktop requires only Git 2.0.0 or greater. Unless it detects an older version of Git it won't try to install Git. Exploratory Desktop assumes that Git is installed under /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, so for any reason if your Git is installed somewhere else then it might try to install Git because it thinks that Git is not there. If that's the case and you don't want another Git to be installed please contact support@exploratory.io .

## What R packages are you installing and why ?

Exploratory Desktop uses a number of amazing R packages, most of which are coming from 'Hadleyverse' - a set of R packages to make your data wrangling and analysis more effective and fun. You can see a list of the R packages to be installed in the initial setup UI by clicking a blue text 'See a list of software and libraries to be installed.' or select 'View Licenses' from Toolbar menu / Help. These are the packages that we use to make your data access and data analysis more effective.

## Where are you installing R packages ?

The recent version of Exploratory Desktop (1.4.1 or later) installs them into Exploratory's repository, which is different from the regular R installation location. This is to avoid any conflict with your own R environment.

## Can I add my preferred R packages ?

We have a plan to support this. If you have such requirement please contact support@exploratory.io . We would love to hear your requirement and discuss how to make it possible.

## I have very sensitive data. Where my data is stored ?

Once you import your data into Exploratory it stays inside Exploratory Desktop's repository that is located on your PC, under ~/.exploratory. Your data stays on your PC and never leave your PC.

## Can I change my username ?

We are not currently supporting it, but we will in future release. If you need it to be changed now, please contact support@exploratory.io, we can manually change it at the server for you.
