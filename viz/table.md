# Table

You can view the raw data quickly with Table. 


## Assignments
* Columns - You can select which columns to show in the table. See [Column Configuration](column-configuration.md) for detail.  
* Number of Rows - You can select how many rows to show at "# of Rows" control. You can also change either showing the first rows or last rows in the data frame. 


* Max # of Columns - You can select how many columns to show at "Max # of Columns" control. You can choose either "300", "1,000" or "10,000". Note that if you have many columns and choose a large number here, it may slow down the table rendering. 

## Sort 

You can sort by the column by clicking the column header.  If it is a numeric column, it also shows the micro bar charts. Note that the sort happens only for the rows fetched. 


## Search

You can search the Table by typing in a keyword in the search input field. If you type in a keyword, the Table shows only matched rows with the keyword highlighted.
