You can share and schedule your data and charts by publishing to Exploratory Cloud server (exploratory.io).

You can also install Exploratory Collaboration Server on your servers so that you can share and schedule at your own instead of publishing to Exploratory Cloud. If you want to know more about Exploratory Collaboration Server please contact [Exploratory Support team](mailto:support@exploratory.io).
