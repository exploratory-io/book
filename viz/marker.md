# Marker Type

In Line and Scatter charts, you can change the marker type for each Y-Axis from the Marker Setting dialog. You can access the dialog by selecting `Marker` menu from Y-Axis property dropdown.

You can select one of the following marker types. The default value is `(Default)` which follows the base chart type. If you select Line Chart, it will be Line. 

* (Default) - It shows the same markers as the base chart type. For example, if you select Line Chart, it will be Line.  
* Line
* Circle
* Bar

For Circle marker type, you can optionally set the circle size. For the Line marker type, you can optionally set the line width.

If you have multiple Y-Axises defined, you can set marker type for each Y-Axis independently so that you can mix different marker types in the same chart. For example, you can set `Line` marker for Y1-Axis, and `Circle` for Y2-Axis.
