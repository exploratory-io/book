You can change the following configurations.



* Assign to Y2: If you check it, the column is assigned to Y2 axis (on the right hand side of the chart).
* Sync Y1 & Y2 Scale at Zero: If you check it, it will align the Y-axis zero lines on Y1 and Y2. 
* Show Axis Names: If you check it, it shows which axis (either "(Y1)" or "(Y2)") is assigned for each column in the legend.



This menu currently shows up in Y-Axis menu only when you have multiple columns at Y-Axis.
