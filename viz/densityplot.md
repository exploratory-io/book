##  Density Plot 

You can show the distribution of the data by the curved lines. This chart is a variation of a Histogram, but this can show the smoother distributions by smoothing out the noise.

## Column Assignments

* X-Axis - Assign a column you want to show the distribution. The column data should be numeric. 
* Color By - Assign a column for color. Take a look at [Color](color.md) section for more details.
* Repeat By - You can assign a column to repeat the chart for each of its values. Take a look at [Small Multiple](small-multiple.md) section for more details.
* Include Outlier - You can uncheck to exclude the outlier values. 


## Layout Configuration


* Bandwidth Adjustment - Decides the smoothness of lines. You can assign a numeric value. If you assign a larger number, the curve will be simpler. 
* Number of Equally Spaced Points - How many data points used to draw the line. If you assign a larger number, the curve will be smoother. 
* Bandwidth - Smoothing bandwidth option. 
* Kernel - Smoothing kernel option. 


Take a look at [Layout Configuration](layout.md) on how to configure the layout and format.
