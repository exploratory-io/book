## Column Assignments

* Orientation - You can choose a chart orientation. Either 'Vertical' or 'Horizontal'.
* X-Axis - Assign a column you want to show at X-Axis. If it's a Date / Time column assigned, you can select the aggregation level such as `Month`, `Week`, `Day`, etc. If you assign a Number column, you can choose either `As Number` to treat values as continuous values or `As Text` to treat values as categorical values.  
* Y-Axis - Assign a column you want to show at Y-Axis. If it's a Numeric column assigned, you can set the aggregation function such as `Sum`, `Mean (Average)`, etc. to aggregate the values. You can also assign a Window Calculation from the gear icon on Y-Axis. Look at [Window Calculation](window-calc.md) section for details.  
* Color - Take a look at [Color](color.md) section for more details.
* Sort - Assign a column to use for Sorting the X-Axis values. The default is based on either the alphabetic order or the factor level order for Factor type columns.
* Repeat By - You can assign a column to repeat the chart for each of its values. Take a look at [Small Multiple](small-multiple.md) section for more details.

You can assign multiple columns to Y-Axis. Take a look at [Multiple Y-Axis](multi-y.md) section for more details.

* In this orientation type, X-Axis goes vertically and Y-Axis goes horizontally in order to make it easy to switch between horizontal and vertical orientation.
* At this moment, the horizontal orientation doesn't support [Small Multiple](small-multiple.md).

You can select from one of the following bar types. The default is `Stacked`.
