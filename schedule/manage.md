# Publish Insights

In order to schedule your insight, you need to publish your insight to the server first. See the [document](/product-features/share) for mote details.


# Manage Schedules

You can click the clock icon to open the scheduling dialog for managing schedules. 

If the insight is not capable for scheduling, the clock icon doesn't show up. The popular reasons are the following.

* Data is coming from your local file. The data should be accessible from the network for scheduling.  
* Data source type doesn't support scheduling such as "R Script" data source.

* Every N Minutes (Available only for Business plan users)

You can check the "Subscribe Notification Email" checkbox to receive the notification for every scheduling run.

Click the "Save Configuration" button at the bottom once the setting is done.
