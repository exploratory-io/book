Analyzing which customers churn and why seems to fit for the typical machine learning topic. But given that the probability of customer churns is greatly influenced by the customer lifetime, the typical machine learning models are not good fit.

As we have seen in the series of Cohort Analysis seminars, the survival curve gives us a good picture of how the customer churn changes over time. It turned out that there are statistical and machine learning models that we can use to predict the survival curve. By using these models, we can analyze what makes customers churn and predict who could churn.

In this seminar, Kan will introduce Cox Regression Model and Random Survival Model to analyze the customer churn with live demo.
