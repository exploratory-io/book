# Seminar #85 - Hypothesis Testing with Chi-Squared Test
## Date/Time: 3/29/2023 (Wed) Noon ET / 9AM PT / 5PM GMT / 6PM CET
## Duration: 1 hour
## Meeting URL: [https://zoom.us/j/331585134](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/331585134?pwd=VGVyeXBRWjFMT2hESFdhSU45Z2d0dz09)

This is a part of the Hypothesis Testing series. This time, we will introduce Chi-Square Test, which is to test hypotheses about the relationship between two categorical variables.

Let's say you want to know if there is any difference in terms of effectiveness between wearing mask and not wearing mask. We have a variable of 'Infection' whose values would be 'Infected' or 'Not Infected' and a variable of 'Wearing Mask' whose values would be 'Yes' and 'No'. Are there any relationship between these two variables?

That's the kind of question we can use Chi-Square Test to answer.

In this seminar, Kan will introduce the Chi-Square Test and how to interpret the result by using Exploratory.

Agenda:

- Introduction to Chi-Square Test
- How to Use in Exploratory
- How to Interpret the Result
