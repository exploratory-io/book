This is a part of the Exploratory Data Analysis Workshop. In this episode, we'll get into how we can find what makes a difference between two groups so that, for example, we can answer questions like "what makes a difference between those who sign up and those who don't."

* Error Bar
* Chi-Square Test
* Logistic Regression
