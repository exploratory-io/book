# Seminar #88 - Introduction to Multivariate Analysis with Linear Regression
## Date/Time: 4/19/2023 (Wed) Noon ET / 9AM PT / 5PM GMT / 6PM CET
## Duration: 1 hour
## Meeting URL: [https://zoom.us/j/331585134](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/331585134?pwd=VGVyeXBRWjFMT2hESFdhSU45Z2d0dz09)

When you have found correlated relationships among the variables, that's a great news. You can use the information to explain what is happening and predict what is going to happen. But, you don't stop there. More often than not, that correlation you found could involve something called 'confounding', which is a fancy word for a 'hidden cause' - another variable that creates such relationship.

And this is where you want to perform Multivariate Analysis. It can help you investigate further to see if there are such 'confounding' elements among the variables and find out how much of the effect the prediction variables have on the target variable independently.

In this seminar, Kan will introduce Multivariate Analysis by using Linear Regression models, discuss why and when you need, and walk you through how you can perform it in Exploratory.

Agenda:

- Correlation and Confounding
- Difference between Univariate and Multivariate Analysis
- How to Interpret Prediction Models for Multivariable Analysis
- Limitation & Recommendation
