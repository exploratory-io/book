# Seminar #88 - Introduction to Multivariate Analysis with Linear Regression
## Date/Time: 4/19/2023 (Wed) Noon ET / 9AM PT / 5PM GMT / 6PM CET
## Duration: 1 hour
## Meeting URL: [https://zoom.us/j/331585134](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/331585134?pwd=VGVyeXBRWjFMT2hESFdhSU45Z2d0dz09)

When you have found correlated relationships among the variables, that's a great news. You can use the information to explain what is happening and predict what is going to happen. But, you don't stop there. More often than not, that correlation you found could involve something called 'confounding', which is a fancy word for a 'hidden cause' - another variable that creates such relationship.

And this is where you want to perform Multivariate Analysis. It can help you investigate further to see if there are such 'confounding' elements among the variables and find out how much of the effect the prediction variables have on the target variable independently.

In this seminar, Kan will introduce Multivariate Analysis by using Linear Regression models, discuss why and when you need, and walk you through how you can perform it in Exploratory.

Agenda:

- Correlation and Confounding
- Difference between Univariate and Multivariate Analysis
- How to Interpret Prediction Models for Multivariable Analysis
- Limitation

# Seminar #89 - Multicollinearity - Why that's a problem & How to Detect and Address it with your Regression Models
## Date/Time: 4/26/2023 (Wed) Noon ET / 9AM PT / 5PM GMT / 6PM CET
## Duration: 1 hour
## Meeting URL: [https://zoom.us/j/331585134](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/331585134?pwd=VGVyeXBRWjFMT2hESFdhSU45Z2d0dz09)

Have you heard about ‘Multicollinearity’?

If you are doing multivariate analysis with the Statistical Learning models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, etc. this is the first thing you need to check. Otherwise, your analysis around the coefficients could be unstable, and that's not where you want to do be.

The word multicollinearity sounds intimidating and a bit mysterious. But the idea behind it is not as complicated as you would think.

In this seminar, Kan will introduce what the 'Multicollinearity' is and walks you through how the detection mechanics works. Then, he'll demonstrate how you can detect and address the problem with Exploratory.

Agenda:

- What is Multicollinearity?
- How to Detect?
- How to Address with Exploratory?
