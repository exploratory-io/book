RFM Analysis helps you understand your customers better based on the following three metrics.

- Recency - how recent they have purchased
- Frequency - how often they have purchased
- Monetary - how much they have spent  

By calculating these metric values for each customer, then you can segment your customers so that you can prioritize which customers to contact first and how to approach them to improve their engagement.

In this seminar, Kan will present a way to prepare and visualize data for RFM Analysis.
