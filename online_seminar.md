## Duration: 1 hour
## Meeting URL: [https://zoom.us/j/331585134](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/331585134?pwd=VGVyeXBRWjFMT2hESFdhSU45Z2d0dz09)

Have you heard about ‘Multicollinearity’?

If you are doing multivariate analysis with the Statistical Learning models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, etc. this is the first thing you need to check. Otherwise, your analysis around the coefficients could be unstable, and that's not where you want to do be.

The word multicollinearity sounds intimidating and a bit mysterious. But the idea behind it is not as complicated as you would think.

In this seminar, Kan will introduce what the 'Multicollinearity' is and walks you through how the detection mechanics works. Then, he'll demonstrate how you can detect and address the problem with Exploratory.

Agenda:

- What is Multicollinearity?
- How to Detect?
- How to Address with Exploratory?
