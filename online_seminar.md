'How should I prepare my data so that I can visualize and analyze it after importing it in Exploratory?'

There are various ways to have the same data set but there is always one 'right' format to have the data to easily visualize and analyze. That is called 'Tidy Data', or sometimes also called as 'Long Data'.

But the chances are, your data is often not in the 'right' format, especially the data is coming from spreadsheets like Excel or other text files.

The good news is, you can easily transform such data into the 'right' format in Exploratory so that you can visualize and analyze them quickly!

In this seminar, Kan will discuss the common problems when you import data, introduce Tidy Data, the format that you want to prepare for, and demonstrate how you can solve various data format problems in Exploratory.

Agenda:

- Common problems when you import data
- Introduction to Tidy Data
- Transform Wide Data to Long Data
