When you want to analyze what makes your customers convert, sign up, respond, etc. with data, building binary classification models with either machine learning or statistical learning algorithms would be a great tool to use.

When you build such models though, how would you know your models are good or bad?

That's where AUC and F value come in. They are the two metrics that are used often to evaluate the prediction quality of the models.

In this seminar, Kan will discuss what AUC and F value are, why and when you need them, and how to use them in Exploratory.
