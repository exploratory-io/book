The foundation of data analysis is to understand the variance in data. If you react every ups and downs of business metrics you'll end up breaking yourself, your team, or business. On the other hand, if you don't react to special kind of ups and downs of business metrics you will miss opportunities to improve or fix your business.

So the question is, how can we differentiate the ups/downs that you don't need to react and the ones that you should react?

This is why you need XmR chart, which is to help you separate signals (special variance) from noises (general variance) from your time series data.

With the recently release of Exploratory v10, you can now quickly create the XmR charts. In this seminar, Kan will introduce XmR Chart and discuss why you need it and how you can use it effectively.

- What is XmR Chart
