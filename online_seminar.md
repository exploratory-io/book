This is the second part of ANOVA Introduction series.

With One-Way ANOVA you can test the difference in the target variable has anything to do with the explanatory variable.

But, what if the difference is also coming from another factor?

This is when you want to use Two-Way ANOVA which lets you bring in another explanatory variable and see if each of the explanatory variables is significant and how they are related to the target variable.

In this seminar, Kan will introduce the Two-Way ANOVA and demonstrate how you can use it and understand the result.

Agenda:

- Introduction to Two-Way ANOVA
- Interaction
- Effect Size
- Post-Hoc Analysis

This is a part of the Hypothesis Testing series. We'd encourage you take a look at the seminar recording for [Hypothesis Test](https://exploratory.io/note/kanaugust/Seminar-83-Introduction-to-Hypothesis-Testing-UII5IOW1bn) if you're not familiar with the thinking framework behind the hypothesis testing.
