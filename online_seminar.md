# Seminar #75 - A Grammar of Analytics - Model Agnostic Interpretability for Machine Learning
## Date/Time: 2022/10/26 (Wed) Noon ET / 9AM PT / 5PM GMT / 6PM CET
## Duration: 1 hour
## Meeting URL: [https://zoom.us/j/331585134](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/331585134?pwd=VGVyeXBRWjFMT2hESFdhSU45Z2d0dz09)

Building Statistical / Machine Learning models is an effective way for understanding the relationship among the variables. But understanding of what each type of the models is another story. In the world of data science, most of the times each type of the models (e.g. Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) produces the result in its own way. This means that you need to learn how to interpret the result for each model type.

With Exploratory, we provide a consistent framework called 'Grammar of Analytics', which produces a same set of outputs along with visualization that help you interpret the model intuitively for all the Statistical / Machine Learning models. This means, once you learn the basics of the Grammar of Analytics, now you can understand the result of any of the models in the same manner.

In this seminar, Kan will introduces the Grammar of Analytics and show you how you can understand the model outputs with Exploratory.

Agenda:

- Prediction Models
- A Grammar of Analytics
- Correlation & Causation
