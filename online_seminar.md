# Data Wrangling for Data Visualization
## Date/Time: 10/28 (Wed) - 11AM PT (US) / 2PM ET (US) / 6PM GMT / 8PM CET
## Duration: 1 hour
## Meeting URL: [Zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/331585134?pwd=VGVyeXBRWjFMT2hESFdhSU45Z2d0dz09)

Once you get your data, more often than not, you'd find a need to clean and transform the data before even visualizing it to make any sense. We call this task Data Wrangling.

In this seminar, I'm going to introduce a few commonly used techniques to clean and transform data with COVID-19 data.

* Transform Wide data to Long data
* Convert Text to Date data type
* Calculate the difference from the previous row with Lag function
* Join with another data frame
* Knowing these simple techniques is essential for creating effective visualizations.

This is a part of the Data Visualization Workshop. The past recording and tutorial slides can be found at the [workshop page](https://exploratory.io/note/kanaugust/Data-Visualization-Workshop-YAZ6azM0MU).

## Date/Time: TBD
## Duration: 1 hour
## Meeting URL: [https://zoom.us/j/331585134](https://zoom.us/j/331585134)

This is a part of the Exploratory Data Analysis Workshop. We'll start by introducing some of the effective methods to understand data variation.

* Data Distribution and Variation
* Summary Metrics
* Introduction to Highlight

# Exploratory Data Analysis Part 2 - Correlation and Association
## Date/Time: TBD
## Duration: 1 hour
## Meeting URL: [https://zoom.us/j/331585134](https://zoom.us/j/331585134)

This is a part of the Exploratory Data Analysis Workshop. In this episode, we'll talk about the correlation and association between variables and introduce some effective methods to investigate such relationships.

* Correlation - Pearson / Spearman
* Association
* Kruskal-Wallis Test
* Linear Regression

# Exploratory Data Analysis Part 3 - What makes a difference between the two
## Date/Time: TBD
## Duration: 1 hour
## Meeting URL: [https://zoom.us/j/331585134](https://zoom.us/j/331585134)

This is a part of the Exploratory Data Analysis Workshop. In this episode, we'll get into how we can find what makes a difference between two groups so that, for example, we can answer questions like "what makes a difference between those who sign up and those who don't."

* Confidence Interval
* Error Bar
* Chi-Square Test
* Logistic Regression
