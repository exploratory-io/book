# Seminar #51 - Machine Learning - How Variable Importance Works
## Date/Time: 7/7/2021
## Duration: 1 hour
## Meeting URL: [https://zoom.us/j/331585134](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/331585134?pwd=VGVyeXBRWjFMT2hESFdhSU45Z2d0dz09)

In Exploratory, when you build machine learning or statistical learning models you will see a tab called 'Importance' that shows which variables are more important to predict a given target variable values.

In this seminar, Kan will explain how the variable importance is calculated as well as how to interpret the result. Also, he's going to introduce a method called 'Boruta', which is used address challenges brought by the randomness of the Random Forest models.
