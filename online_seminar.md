# Seminar #84 - Hypothesis Testing with t-Test
## Date/Time: 3/8/2023 (Wed) Noon ET / 9AM PT / 5PM GMT / 6PM CET
## Duration: 1 hour
## Meeting URL: [https://zoom.us/j/331585134](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/331585134?pwd=VGVyeXBRWjFMT2hESFdhSU45Z2d0dz09)

When you have two groups and see a difference in the means between them, is that big enough for us to take actions or spend more time to investigate about the difference? Or, maybe the difference is so marginal that we'd better move on?

One of the hypothesis methods called t-test helps us to answer these questions.

In this seminar, Kan will introduce what t-test is and how you can use it to test the difference between two groups.

This is a part of the Hypothesis Testing series. If you haven't yet we'd strongly recommend you watch '[Introduction to Hypothesis Testing](https://exploratory.io/note/kanaugust/Seminar-83-Introduction-to-Hypothesis-Testing-UII5IOW1bn)' first.
