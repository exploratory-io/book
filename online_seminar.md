# Introduction to Exploratory Data Catalog - Democratizing Data within Your Organization
## Date/Time: 2019/12/11 (Wed) 11AM PT (US) / 2PM ET (US)

Many teams are facing challenges for democratizing Data Science within their organizations, not because Data Science is hard, but because the data is not ready.

Who can access to what level of data? Which versions of spreadsheets are the right ones to use? How can we clean and transform this data so that it can be ready for visualizing and analyzing?

These are the common questions many teams need to answer before doing Data Science.

At this seminar, Kan will discuss and demonstrate how Exploratory Data Catalog, which has been released very recently, can help you not only address these challenges but also can promote democratizing Data within your organizations.
