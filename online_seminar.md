We have just released Exploratory v12, and the highlight of this release is a feature called ​“Data Wrangling with AI Prompt”, which allows you to transform and clean your data using natural language and AI.

We truly believe this marks a paradigm shift in data wrangling, and as Exploratory enters its 10th year, we’re incredibly excited to be at the forefront of this new era.

I'm going to introduce the new Data Wrangling with AI Prompt feature with a background story of the paradigm shift in Data Wrangling and also talk about how you can quickly take advantage of the feature efficiently.

Please come and join us!
