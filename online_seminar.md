We hear the word 'Probability' almost everyday, but most of us don't quite understand what 'Probability' really means. But not having a proper understanding of it makes it harder to understand most of the statistical methods and thinking and to make better decisions for everyday life.

In this seminar, Kan will discuss what the probability is, how to interpret it in real life, and how it can be used in the statistical thinking to make better decisions.

Agenda:

- What is Probability?
- Probability is different from Statistics
- Interpretation of Probability
- How it's used in Statistical Thinking
