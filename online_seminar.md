We have just released Exploratory v8!

The theme for this release is 'Elephant in the room'. As the name suggests, we wanted to address the problems that have been there for a long time and everybody knew them but almost accepted that's how it is.

In this seminar, Kan will introduce critical new features for such problems along with other product improvements.

Agenda:

- Undo / Restore / Version Control
- Readability Improvement for Data Wrangling Step
- Redesigned Chart Property UI
- Real Time Notification for Collaboration
- Other important improvements
