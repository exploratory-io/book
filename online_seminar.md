Regular Expression is a powerful tool that everyone who needs to clean and transform data should be able to use. It is a very flexible way to match any letters in data that you want to remove, replace, or extract.

In Exploratory, most of the text data cleaning problems can be addressed by clicking one of the menu options inside the Text Data Wrangling UI. But in some cases, you want to use Regular Expression to match with some tricky letters that are buried in data to clean them up.

In this seminar, Kan will introduce the basics of Regular Expressions and show you how you can use them to flexibly clean up your text data with examples. 

Agenda:

- Introduction to Regular Expression
- Commonly Used Types of Regular Expressions
- Example: Clean up Data with Regular Expression
