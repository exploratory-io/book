The published data can be downloaded and imported into your project along with the data transformation steps so that others can understand how the data was prepared, can reproduce the data with all the steps, and can modify or add their own steps. This would make it easier for you to collaborate with your team members through data.  

- New remote data support - Redshift, PostgreSQL - Now you can write SQL queries to extract data from these two data sources, much like existing MySQL / MongoDB options.

- tidyr is upgraded to v0.5.1. The biggest new addition with this upgrade is 'separate_rows' function, which would separate delimited words into rows. [Detail](https://github.com/hadley/tidyr/releases)

Note that 'distinct' function has been updated to keep only the specified columns and this might break your transformation steps. You can bring those dropped columns back with '.keep_all=TRUE' argument. Also, now column names with multibyte characters is supported in 'mutate' command. Great news for users in East Asia!

- Reproducible! with R script generation - Now the generated R script contains all the core R packages with 'library' commands and '.libPaths' command to set the library path to Exploratory repository. This will make it a lot easier to reproduce the transformation steps outside of Exploratory Desktop, such as R console, RStudio, etc.


### Bug fixes

- Chart - Now you can open Chart view even when an referenced column is not available after some updates in the previous steps.
- Column names with Multibyte characters can be processed correctly with mutate / summarize commands now.
- Now it shows up to 300 columns and 1000 rows in Table view correctly even when there are a lot more columns in the data frame.

## R 1.5.2

Released on 6/20/2016

### Enhancements

- Updated all the machine learning functions spec, including text mining, statistical functions, to make them consistent.

### Bug fixes

- 'build_kmeans.kv' command was not augmenting the cluster IDs appropriately on top of the original data.

## R 1.5.1

## R 1.5.0

Released on 6/16/2016

### New Features

- Chart Sharing and Embedding - Now you can publish charts directly from inside the data frame without creating a note. The hosted chart will have an unique URL and can be shared with the URL or embedded into your web pages or blog (e.g. Wordpress) with the automatically generated code. Also, you can share the chart URL on other mediums like Twitter, Facebook, Slack, etc, and the chart images will be automatically shown up. [Blog post](https://blog.exploratory.io/introducing-interactive-chart-sharing-and-embedding-4cfb801c063e#.7it0wsko0)
- Branch - You can create one or more branches inside the data frame to quickly experiment different analysis paths. All the branches inside a single data frame can share the common data transformation and analysis path in a main branch while they can have their own different analysis paths. Being able to run multiple experiments by creating multiple branches inside the data frames will enhance the flexibility and efficiency of your exploratory data analysis. Data dependency among the branches and among the transformation steps are managed by Exploratory's DAG engine to keep all the data cache intact. [Blog post](https://blog.exploratory.io/introducing-branch-for-running-multiple-experiments-quickly-84352ce245b6#.150aissqr)
- Text Analytics - We have added a set of the text mining related functions that are designed to work better with 'tidy' data form. By employing these functions, you can quickly tokenize text, remove stop words, stem words, construct n-grams, calculate TF-IDF and document similarity, reduce dimensions with SVD, and building document clustering models.
- Added [Short Cut Keys](http://docs.exploratory.io/shortcut.html) for the command input.

### Enhancements

- Chart: Support custom text entry for Title, X-Axis, and Y-Axis.
- Windows: you can now scroll Table view vertically and horizontally by using the scroll bar as well as using touch pad.

## R 1.4.2

Released on 5/26/2016

### New Features

- Text data wrangling with the tidytext package, which makes it easy to work with text data in a tidy format.

  With this tidytext package introduction, we are introducing unnest_tokens and pair_counts functions from the tidytext package as data frame level functions and get_sentiment and get_stopwords functions from the exploratory package as mutate / filter level functions.

- Introducing 'ip_to_country' function from the rgeolocate package to convert from IP addresses to country names.
- Introducing 'countrycode' function from the countrycode package to map among all the combinations of country names and country codes including ISO2 and ISO3 letters and numbers.

- Support 'model' and 'source data' type columns so that you can build models with functions like do_lm, do_glm, do_kmeans, and store them inside the data frame. This makes it possible to call broom's tidy functions to access the models' statistical summary information or augment their scored data with the original data columns.

### Enhancements
