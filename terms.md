An upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan will immediately bill you.

For monthly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

When changing from a monthly billing cycle to a yearly billing cycle, Exploratory will bill for a full year at the next monthly billing date.

All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.

For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level while on a monthly billing cycle, the credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle. For upgrades or downgrades while on a yearly plan, Exploratory will immediately charge or refund the difference in plan cost, prorated for the remaining time in your yearly billing cycle.

Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Exploratory does not accept any liability for such loss.

All of your Content will be immediately deleted from the Service upon cancellation. This information can not be recovered once your account is cancelled.

Exploratory reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

In the event that Exploratory takes action to suspend or terminate an account, we will make a reasonable effort to provide the affected account owner with a copy of their account contents upon request, unless the account was suspended or terminated due to unlawful conduct.
