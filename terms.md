## B. Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms

All paid plans must enter a valid payment account. Free accounts are not required to provide payment account information.

An upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan will immediately bill you.

For monthly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

When changing from a monthly billing cycle to a yearly billing cycle, Exploratory will bill for a full year at the next monthly billing date.

All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.

For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level while on a monthly billing cycle, the credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle. For upgrades or downgrades while on a yearly plan, Exploratory will immediately charge or refund the difference in plan cost, prorated for the remaining time in your yearly billing cycle.

Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Exploratory does not accept any liability for such loss.

## C. Cancellation and Termination

You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time by clicking on Settings link in the account menu at the right hand side top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple no questions asked cancellation link.

All of your Content will be immediately deleted from the Service upon cancellation. This information can not be recovered once your account is cancelled.

If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not be charged again.

Exploratory, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Product and Service, or any other Exploratory service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. Exploratory reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

In the event that Exploratory takes action to suspend or terminate an account, we will make a reasonable effort to provide the affected account owner with a copy of their account contents upon request, unless the account was suspended or terminated due to unlawful conduct.

Additionally, in the event that an account is suspended or terminated, any unused portion of the amount already paid at that time will be refunded.

As of the current date (April 4th, 2025), since the service began in May 2016, no paid accounts have been suspended nor terminated. However, with respect to free accounts (during the trial period or with the Public plan), we have had to delete accounts created based on spam or security concerns.

The following are cases in which we may suspend or terminate an account:

* Modifying, altering, or tampering with the service in a way that falsely implies an association with Exploratory or any other Exploratory service.
* Reproducing, duplicating, copying, selling, reselling, or exploiting any part of the products and services, service usage, or access to the service without explicit written permission from Exploratory.
* Publishing content that is illegal, offensive, threatening, defamatory, libelous, pornographic, obscene, or otherwise objectionable, or that may violate the intellectual property of others or these terms of use.
* Engaging in verbal, physical, written, or any form of abuse (including threats of abuse or retaliation) towards Exploratory customers, members, employees, or officers.
* Uploading, posting, hosting, or sending unsolicited emails, SMS, "spam" messages, viruses, or any code of a * destructive nature.
* Accounts created or maintained by individuals associated with organized crime or other antisocial forces.

If such issues are discovered, and unless the account is immediately suspended or terminated due to illegal activity, we will contact the account owner in advance regarding the issue. If it is not an issue, the account holder will need to explain or prove this. If the issue is not resolved, the account may be suspended or terminated.


## D. Temporary Suspension for non-payment

Exploratory reserves the right to suspend your access to Exploratory' Products in the event that you fail to make payment for its subscription.

If Exploratory suspends your access to Exploratory' Products for non-payment, you must pay all past due amounts in order to restore its access to Exploratory' Products.

You hereby agree that Exploratory is entitled to charge you for the time period during which you have access to Exploratory Products until you or Exploratory terminates or suspends your subscription in accordance with this agreement.
