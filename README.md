Exploratory Desktop Documentation
========

# Introduction

Exploratory Desktop provides an advanced, interactive, and reproducible data wrangling and analysis experience powered by R and visualization.

This documentation about Exploratory Desktop, you can find instructive information for Exploratory Desktop product features and a set of data wrangling and analysis commands - the Grammar of Data Wrangling by Hadley Wickham. The grammar based commands are the exact same as the ones from 'dplyr' and 'tidyr' of R packages. If you're already familiar with them then you can start right away. Otherwise, you can find useful information here in this documentation, but you might want to check the original reference documents from Hadley Wickham and others who built amazing 'dplyr' and 'tidyr'.

Learning and understanding of the grammar based data wrangling and analysis commands / functions makes it possible for you to not only use them in other R environments like R console, RStudio, etc, but also become experts of the data analysis in general, not an expert of the product. With a clear understanding of the grammar you can work with almost any type of data to wrangle and analyze.

# Tutorials / Getting Started

To help you become familiar with the product and the grammar of data wrangling, we have prepared a set of tutorials. Each tutorial is designed to address a different use case so you don't need to follow any particular order. Rather, based on what you want to do, what type of data or data analysis requirements you have, or what you are curious about, we'd encourage you to start from any of the tutorials.

Sample data files for the tutorials are provided inside of the each tutorial page so that you can download them and start experiencing Exploratory Desktop right away.
