# Write R Script to Get Data

You can write an R script to get data. For example, you might want to use R packages like 'Google Trend' to get search terms trending data, use 'Quantmod' package to get financial data like stock prices, currency exchange rates, etc, or write a program to extract data from  multiple files and combine into one. You can get pretty much any data in any way by writing R script, it's that powerful.
