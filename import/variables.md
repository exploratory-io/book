# Using Variables in SQL

First, define a variable in R script file.

```
cutoff_date <- "\'2016-01-15\'"
```

Note that the ‘\’ (backslash) symbols are used to escape the single quotes, which are required to be used for characters in SQL queries.

Second, load the R script file.

Finally, you can use @{} to surround a variable name inside the query like below.

```
select *
from airline_2016_01
where fl_date > @{cutoff_date}
```
