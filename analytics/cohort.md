# Cohort Analysis
Visualizes how a measure for each cohort (group) changes as time goes by. 

## Input Data
Each row of the input data should represent one observation (e.g. number of active users on 7/1/2017 who joined at 3/1/2017). It should have following columns.

* Activity Date - A Date or POSIXct column with the beginning of the observation of the subject. You can also set the unit of the period such as by week, by month etc at the sub dropdown menu. 
* Measure - A column with numeric data. 
* Cohort By - A column with the cohort (group) data. Non text data such as numerical data or date date is handled as categorical. 
* Other columns to group observations - Optionally, if there are other columns that groups subjects, they can be used to draw separate survival curves for each group, for comparison between groups.
