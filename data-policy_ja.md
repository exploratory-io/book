# Exploratory Cloud Data Policy

## Responsibility

You are responsible for the content you publish to Exploratory Cloud (https://exploratory.io). We are not the owners or publishers of the data on our servers. We don’t screen content before it is published and we don’t make decisions about what content can exist on Exploratory Cloud except as described in this policy. You should be mindful of the data you choose to post. If you publish libelous or defamatory statements about someone, you can be sued by that person.

If you 'publicly' publish confidential data about your customers that they would expect you to keep private, they might seek recourse, including legal action. If you publish data about people that embarrasses them, you can expect them to get angry at you.

You should publish any confidential data 'privately' by choosing the 'private' option at the publishing time, and not 'publicly' publish. Once it is posted 'publicly' you should expect that data to be no longer private.

## Guiding principle

Our core guiding principle is the freedom of speech. However, even under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, there are limits to free speech and there are risks of liability for certain kinds of speech or content. Exploratory generally allows content to be posted to Exploratory Cloud unless such content may create liability for Exploratory. Accordingly, Exploratory reserves the right (but assumes no obligation) to remove such content, including:

* Content that infringes third party copyright, trademark, or publicity rights - Exploratory may remove content for which it has received a proper notice of claimed copyright infringement or a notice of trademark or publicity rights infringement.
* Obscene content, child pornography, and content depicting the exploitation of children - Exploratory may remove and/or report to appropriate authorities any such content that it finds or about which it is notified.
* Content that incites violence - Exploratory may remove any content that incites violence.
* Content that violates U.S. federal criminal law - Exploratory may remove content that violates U.S. federal law, such as content regarding the current number and location of troops deployed in times of war.
We will follow closely our goal to support the freedom of speech within the bounds of the law.

## A formal process to take down content

Although we reserve the right to screen or monitor content on our systems, we generally do not do so. If you discover content that you believe should be taken down, you may file a complaint in this way:

You may submit a request to take down content via email(support@exploratory.io). The request must include specific information about the allegedly offending content. If your complaint is about copyright, trademark, or publicity rights infringement you must be the copyright owner.

Upon receiving a request:

* If the complaint claims infringement of copyright, we will promptly remove the content pending a counter-notice.
* If the complaint claims (1) infringement of trademark, privacy, or publicity rights, or (2) that the content is obscene, child pornography, or depicts the exploitation of children, we may, in our discretion, remove the content.
* If the complaint makes some other claim, we may, in our discretion, take down the content while the complaint is evaluated. Our bias will be to not take down content while we evaluate the complaint.
* If we do take down content, we’ll notify the user who posted it.

For copyright infringement complaints:

* Exploratory will notify the user who posted the applicable content that a complaint has been received and the content has been taken down.
* The user can file a counter-notice claiming that he or she has the right to post the content:
Exploratory will inform the complainant and provide a copy of the counter-notice; and
* If the copyright owner does not notify us within 14 days of receiving the counter-notice that he or she has brought a suit for copyright infringement, we’ll put the content back up.

As of today this policy outlines what kinds of content Exploratory will remove from the Exploratory Public servers. Content on the web is, by its very nature, an evolving area. Therefore Exploratory may, from time to time, revise this policy.
