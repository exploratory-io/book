This [note](https://exploratory.io/note/kei/9285503110951652) explains how to create Presentation Slides with Exploratory Desktop and share them with your co-workers.

You can take a look at [this 'Remark.js' wiki page](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki), which we use it internally for rendering the slides, for all the formatting options supported.
