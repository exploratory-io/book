Tutorial
========

Exploratory Desktop provides an advanced, interactive, and reproducible data wrangling and analysis experience powered by R and visualization.  

To help you become familiar with the product and the grammar of data wrangling, we have prepared a set of tutorials. Each tutorial is designed to address a different use case so you don't need to follow any particular order. Rather, we'd encourage you to start from any of the tutorials you are interested in, based on your data analysis requirements and what you are curious about.

### Sample Data

Sample data files for the tutorials are provided inside of the each tutorial page so that you can download them and start experiencing Exploratory Desktop right away.
