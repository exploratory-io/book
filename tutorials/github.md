# Analyze project issues data from Github

How many open issues are ?
How are they trending ? (line chart)
What are the average of closing time ?
Are they improving ? - calculate the difftime and use the created_at as X-axis to show line chart?
Any trend/pattern by type of issues ? Critical issues, Regression issues - use boxplot and created_at as X-axis

Based on the information from the past, I want to see how we can manage to close all the issues, how can we improve the overall product development and quality control processes better. In another words, how long will it takes to close those issues, where the bottlenecks are for fixing those issues, what are the trend of the issues inflow and outflow. Being able to ask and answer these questions quickly we can not only anticipate in future but also correct the actions and prepare for the better outcome.
