#### 3. Type the package name and click on Install button.


## Install R Packages that are not on CRAN

If you want to install R packages that are not on CRAN, then you can install them in the standard R console by setting ‘libPath’ so that the packages will be installed into the location Exploratory is referencing to, which is under <your home directory>/.exploratory/R .

Example:
```
.libPaths("~/.exploratory/R/3.4")
install.packages("./h2o_3.14.0.3.tar.gz", repos = NULL)
```

If you want to use the functions from this custom R package as part of the command line then you want to add a custom R Script file that contains ‘library’ call so that your custom R package will be loaded. Please refer to [this blog post](https://blog.exploratory.io/adding-custom-r-scripts-to-extend-exploratory-desktop-a054832b9562#.68ny44np1) for how to add R Script to the projects.
