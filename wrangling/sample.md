1. Enter Sample Number - Number of rows you want to sample the data. (e.g. 10000)
2. Select `Weight Colulmn` (Optional) - Sampling weight. The ratio of probability the row should be chosen. This should be non-negative numeric vector whose size is the number of rows. It's normalized so that the sum of the probability will be 1.
3. Replace Sampled Rows (Options) - The default is FALSE. If it's TRUE, replacement will be executed when sampling.
4. Click "Run" to Sample data frame.

## Sample (Fraction)
